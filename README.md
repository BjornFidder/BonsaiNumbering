# BonsaiNumbering
BonsaiNumbering is a Blender add-on that provides a user interface for generating and managing sequential numbering within your Bonsai projects. The tool integrates directly into Blender, making it easy to assign unique, consistent numbers to objects or elements as part of your workflow.

## Features
See the Demo video for a quick overview of the features.
- Assign sequential numbers to selected IFC objects or elements in Blender.
- Customizable numbering formats with support for element, type, and storey numbers.
- Save and load multiple named numbering settings directly in the IFC project file, or export settings to a json file.
- Store numbers in IFC Tag, custom property set, or the common property set (instance or type).
- Storey numbering and custom storey number assignment.
- Duplicate number checking and removal from unselected objects.
- Undo/redo integration with Blender's history.
- User-friendly, compact interface accessible from the Blender sidebar.

## Usage
The tool is combined into one Python script file, which when run in Blender, loads the tool in the UI part of the 3D viewport.
